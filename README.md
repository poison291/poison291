# 👋 Hey, I'm Susan  

I'm a **backend-focused Go developer** who enjoys designing and building reliable systems from the ground up.  
I specialize in creating **scalable APIs, well-structured services, and clean database architectures** that are built for performance and long-term maintainability.

While I can work across the stack when needed, my primary focus is **backend engineering, system design, and writing efficient Go code**.  
Most of my learning comes from building real-world projects and solving practical engineering problems.
