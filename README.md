# 👋 Hey, I'm Susan

I'm a full-stack web developer who loves **building projects from scratch**, from clean interfaces to robust backends.  
I work with modern JavaScript frameworks and backend tools, focusing on **well-structured databases, reliable APIs, and intuitive user experiences**.  
Most of my learning comes from hands-on projects and solving real problems.
